## Contribute to the service catalog?

Datalab services are applications [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) which are structured with chart models [Helm](https://helm.sh). The charts help to define, install and upgrade the different applications made with Kubernetes. These models are easy to create, version, share, and publish. So start using Helm and contribute to our datascience catalog!
